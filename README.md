Objectives: 

Our primary objective is to develop a robust database application that empowers restaurant owners and staff to seamlessly manage customer details, allergies, and preferences. By centralizing this information, we aim to enhance the efficiency of restaurant operations and improve the overall dining experience for customers. Additionally, our system will facilitate the storage and retrieval of customer data, enabling personalized service and efficient food preparation.
